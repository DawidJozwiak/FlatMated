Accommodation sharing is a phenomenon that occurs when a few tenants share a single rental dwelling unit to spread the costs of maintaining it between themselves. The process of looking for a person to share the accommodation begins with advertising. Flatmate advertisement contains details about personal information, preferred cities, personalized preferences, or life schedule. Fully set advert is later published via press, advertising column or on the Internet. The next step is interviewing potential candidate by conducting online or face-to-face conversation. During that talk, folks discuss important details and specify preferable living conditions. Final stage of seeking a flatmate is selecting the right candidate and setting up final agreements.
Mobile application for potential users interested in looking for a flatmate, can facilitate the whole process by delivering a middleware, which allows them to advertise themselves by setting all necessary details, personal pictures, and their location. On top of that they can specify their living preferences and life-style choices. Next by using their geolocation their advertisement in the form of an information card is being published among the other nearby flat seekers, sorted by matching algorithm and let them swipe candidates that they consider suitable for living together. The application employs a double opt-in mechanism, in which both users must swipe the card to the right in order to be able to exchange messages. After that they can proceed to the following stage which is interviewing potential candidates by using embedded chat to clarify the specifics and details of their future accommodation.
